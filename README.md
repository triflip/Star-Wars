## 🧪 Testing

A testing architecture has been implemented to ensure code stability:

- **Unit Testing**: Custom Hook tests (`useAuthListener`).
- **Component Testing**: Rendering and interaction validation (`StarshipCard`).
- **Integration Testing**: Security flow verification (`ProtectedRoute`).

To run the tests:
```bash
npm  test
